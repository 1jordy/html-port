<h2> Top 3 Favorites Movies </h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Mask</h3>
<p>
    This movie is absolutely one of my top choices. The two main stars: Cameron and Jim. 
    They really spiced it up, you know? And it pertains to life.
</p>

<h3>The Amazing Spider Man 2</h3>
<P>
    TOP TIER! The movie. The story line was crazy wild. In totatlity, it showed a different depiction of the nerd and lover. Gwen Stacy
    and Peter Parker. Then Harry coming back, into the picture after not being in the first movie. 
    And carrying the first movie into it, by adding a different element of responsibility with the Dad.

<h3>Dope</h3>
<p>
    I mean what is there not to love. "Nerdy, geeky kid. No father, blahhh blaahhhh" Although,
    It was a good story line. Pretty funny. Common actors you may know. Cast was crazy. Inclusive, but crazy. Rocky,
    Zoe K. Poundcake dude from Everybody Hates Chris. Model who dated Rocky. The basketball dude. Aye, allstar crew for sure.
